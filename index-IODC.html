<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The present paper aims to bring to discussion on some unintended and unchecked effects of open data policies in Brazil, regarding surveillance and loss of right to privacy over vulnerable communities. The methodology used to achieve that is an exploratory research on laws, bills and other instruments of law enforcement and the relations between this laws and the consequences it brings to human rights protection, especially privacy rights, as it provides for the availability of personal data as public data on the Web. The first part presents an overview of this laws and the connected policies to show the kind of data that is being collected. The second part comprises a series of recomendations ensure that open data government initiatives are side by side with society expectations in this area as a crucial mean for building trust.</p>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The evolution of the Web as a tool for communication and information sharing has increased the possibilities for data innovation, enabling greater connectivity, facilitating the global flow of information and ideas, and increasing the opportunities to expand government's accountability and transparency . As information and communication technologies evolved, so did the means by which States, private companies and researchers sought to collect and monitor citizens information. Inevitably the Web has facilitated the development of large amounts of transactional data by and about individuals. This raised concerns on the effects of potential privacy loss, generally having private sector as a target, specially Internet companies which business models are based on trade and monetization of personal data in order to maintain their leadership in specific markets. 
<p>What must be recognized is that data are bigger, faster and more detailed than ever before, but little or no attention has been given to the fact that governments are being attracted by the power of using data to manage resources and prevent risk situations without taking in consideration invasion of privacy and abuse of human rights from misuse of data on individuals and groups, and minimising inequality in production, access to and use of data. By following a global trend, governments are seeking out high-quality data that can be used to compare outcomes and changes over time and integrating new with traditional data to produce information that is more detailed, timely and relevant for many purposes. In order to foster and monitor public policies, governments expect to increase in the usefulness of data through a much greater degree of openness and transparency. And the same fascination has assaulted scientists and researchers that saw in this information availability another important source of data for research that could lead to new scientific findings on dynamics of human behavior in its economic, social and cultural aspects
</p>
<p>It is no coincidence then that open data initiatives and policies focused on development of database systems have gained space among decision makers in Brazil, who increased the investment and allocated substantial part of public budget in development of digital data tools for management and exchanging of knowledge. Admittedly, it is tempting to think that having the correct information can improve policy choices. For decades, federal, state and local governments have been keeping records about their citizens. Until very recently finding information about a person required long hours of search in public records, but with the widespread of ICTs, popularization of the Web and digitization of tools to collect data in big quantities, personal data is now easily obtained and searched from everywhere. These information about population increasingly has been used for the public sector to identify problems, to head off potential threats, to govern populations, to develop transparency mechanisms, and to deliver valuable social services. </p>
<p>In light of the new technologies and the greater demand to overcome the gap between the  "information-rich and information-poor people", international organizations like United Nations have called governments for a "data revolution‚Äù to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This meant more incentives to "opportunities linked to innovation, technical progress and the surge of new public and private data providers to support and complement conventional statistical systems and strengthen accountability at the global regional and national level". Based on the assumption that governments needed more data for planning and monitoring what they do, and people need data to hold those governments and other institutions accountable, since 2000 the effort involving monitoring the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and now the SDGs has spurred increased investment to improve data collection. As a result, governments in developing countries are being stimulated to know more about issues like the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, gender equality, improvements on maternal health, combat diseases like HIV and others, ensure environmental sustainability, reduce child mortality, universal education and a partnership for development, particularly targeting the poorest people involved in public policies. As a prerequisite to spread the goals achieved on participating of this data revolution, these actions have to be reported to the United Nations bodies, so the people affected by the governmental programs are constantly monitored in order to prove the evolution and flow of the policies recommendations, measuring the progress of the millenium and sustainable goals. 
</p>
<p>In order to understand how public policies and regulation are affecting privacy rights we listed and selected the more critical to those rights, highlighting the emerging risks it poses to low income population and minorities.</p>

<h3>Laws and regulation around millennium goals and other cases</h3>
<p>Open Data policies have turned into an important issue for Brazil mainly because of the commitment assumed in April 2009, when president Dilma Rousseff undertook the responsibility of co-chairing the Open Government Partnership initiative. As a consequence, open government and open data initiatives have progressively being implemented in an attempt to make government information more available and useful. But if at one side open data aims to develop transparency and accountability, at the other the tracking and monitoring activities related to the wrong implementation of such policies can lead to the generation of an innumerable amount of private information that facilitates individual identification, exposing the fragility of such 'open' models of policies for information production and distribution, and how it endangers privacy privacy  and more concrete possibilities of achieving transparency or accountability. </p>
<p>	To map the situation of such programs, laws and public policies and its possible consequences when they are combined with open data we present an introductory research that brings evidence on the possible unchecked effect. By analyzing a brief list of bills from the last ten years that aim to track and register aspects of private life and citizens behavior we expect to bring light to the open data versus data protection dilemma.
</p>
<h4>The 557/2011 Provisory Act</h4>
<p>By 2012 the Presidency created the "National Registration System, Surveillance and Monitoring of Pregnancy" throught a provisory act - meaning that it was not previously discussed with citizens. The 557/2011 Provisory Act regulates the registration of all pregnant women in Brazil through an integrated system. The Act also establishes a payment of R$50 (aprox U$20) to pregnant women who wants public health assistance. The system registers, tracks and keeps a database with information during the whole pregnancy period as well as collect data on all implications and events occurred during the childbirth process. Since abortion is a crime in Brazil, this law also monitors interrupted pregnancy. It was celebrated and justified as a way to the country achieve development goals.
An important aspect of this law is specially connected to impoverished communities. The Act, in it's 10ts paragraph, establishes that:</p>

<cite><strong>Art. 10.</strong>The Federal Government is authorized to provide financial benefit in the amount of up to R $ 50.00 (fifty reais) for pregnant women registered with the National Registration System, Surveillance and Monitoring of Pregnant and Postpartum for the Prevention of Maternal Mortality, in order to assist their displacement and access to actions and health services for the monitoring of prenatal care and childbirth care provided by the SUS, in terms of regulation.</cite>	

<p>Finally, at the the end of the 11th paragraph of the act it establishes the publicization of all the pregnant women that has received the financial benefits, with all the personal data included, as follows:</p>
<cite><strong> Art. 11.</strong>Will be open to the public the list of beneficiaries and their benefits referred to in Article 10. 
</br>
<strong>¬ß</strong>. The relationship referred to in the caput will release on electronic means of public access and other means provided for by regulation.
</cite>
<p>The 557/2011 Provisory Act was substituted in 2012 by a ministerial order because several feminist entities protested against the publication of the personal data. Although this revision, as the pregnant women receive financial benefits through the "Bolsa Fam√≠lia" program, their data is still vulnerable, since the data of Bolsa Fam√≠lia program is completely available due the Open Data initiatives at the ‚ÄúTransparency Portal‚Äù due to the fact it is formally executed by the Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal, the Bank that realizes all the payments of this kind of benefits. 
</p>

<h4>The Act MDS n¬∫ 10/2012</h4>
<p>The "Single Registration for Social Programs", regulated by the Act MDS n¬∫ 10/2012 states in it's manual that family groups deserves special attention to have their data collected, such as follows:</p>
<cite>gypsies, extractivist communities, fishermen, belonging to the community of african religious, people that lives riverine, small farmers, land reform settlers, beneficiaries of the National Program for Land Credit, Camped, Affected by infrastructure development programs, Prisoners of the Penitentiary System and their families, Waste pickers, Indigenous, slaves descendants, redeemed of labor analogous to slavery and individuals that lives in the streets.
</cite>
<p>The act is clear on defining that the data identification data of families registered and tracked by this system are secret and can be used only in this situations: </p>
<cite><strong>I</strong> ‚Äì formulation and management of public policies; and
</br>
<strong>II </strong> ‚Äì studies and research.
</cite>
<p>In "studies and research" there are no further explanations or scope definitions. By stating the entities that have access to the register, the manual alouds that aside from governmental bodies, international NGOs and private companies can have access to the Single Register Data by signing an agreement with the Minister of the Social Development. </p>
<p>	It turns out that the law on access to information (n. 12.527/12) states that "VI - information relevant to the administration of public property, using public resources, procurement, administrative contracts;" should be public and available on the Internet. Through this provision, the Transparency Portal has the obligation to make available every spent of the government reveals personal data of people that receives financial benefits from the social programs. As the figure shows, even the amount that each person received and the identification number are publicized on the Web. </p>
<img src="#">

<p>There are no restrictions on the use of this data and as a consequence it is being reused by dadosbrasil.org - whose owners are protected by privacy at the domain names registrar - and made available to search engines in a more accessible way, as the figure shows. </p>
<p>While making this kind of information available seems useful for transparency reasons and inoffensive for beneficiaries of "Bolsa Fam√≠lia", it is good to remember that all it takes to make something personal is to type one data on a search engine where it is easy to find links to personal profiles in social networking and other combinations that can harm people. 
</p>
<h4>The Act n¬∫ 1.271/2014</h4>
<p>This Act determines a compulsory notification sent to the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health for HIV positive people. According to the text, ‚ÄúThe compulsory notification is mandatory for doctors, health professionals or responsible for public and private health services, providing patient care". At the end of the text, the Act defines rules for disclosure of public data and personal data, as follows:</p>
<cite><strong>Art. 6</strong>The compulsory notification, regardless of how it is fulfilled, will also be recorded in a health information system and follow the information exchange between SUS management levels established by the SVS / MS.
</br>
<strong>Art. 7</strong> The health authorities will ensure the confidentiality of personal information of members reportable under their responsibility.
</br>
<strong>Art. 8</strong> The health authorities shall ensure the dissemination of public updated data from mandatory reporting for health professionals, social control agencies and the general public.
</cite>
<p>The statements regarding privacy are vague, and the way and technology used to store or transmit data is mentioned. The preoccupation with the leak or exposure of data motivated an online petition made my anti-homophobic NGOs asking the government to find another way to accomplish the goals within HIV positive people's health. </p>
<h4>The Law 11.419/2006 </h4>
<p>This law regulates the automation of the judicial process and the disclosure of the information of all the processes and judicial acts. It states that 
</p>
<cite>The courts may create a Journal of Electronic Justice, available on the website of the World Wide Web for publication of judicial and administrative acts and bodies responsible to them, and communications in general.</cite>
<p>As a consequence of this definitions, every citizen that faces any interaction with the judiciary and lives in Brazilian cities that maintains such Journal of Electronic Justice has its data made available on the Web. As in every judicial process, all personal data collected for judicial purposes like phone numbers, personal id and court cases are in pdf format. Although the Child Statute, that says that crimes and situations involving underaged citizen must remain secret, in processes of this nature the data made public on the Web contains:
<ul>
	<li>the initials of the children involved;</li>
	<li>names of both parents;</li>
	<li>lawyer informations, as name and national identification number;</li>
	<li>a brief description of the case;</li>
	<li>dates and cities where the involved are bas</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The only exception in this law is for cases that involves congressman, which proves that the objective is not exactly transparency and accountability. Based on this, it was created a social network dedicated to study and offering lawyers assistance and other facilities related to judiciary problems that is supported by the data mining and collection of the Journal of Electronic Justice. The JusBrasil.com.br is populated by lawyers and citizens, as well as any other kind of people interested in jurisdiction research, and their main source of profit is based on selling virtual access to lawyers by contacting people that they find in the data collected. 	
</p>
<p>The list of Journal of Electronic Justice and the box that offers lawyers and consultancy as soon as users login the social network:</p>
<img src="#">
<p>In 2013 a woman condemned for having committed a crime went to court against Google, asking to remove the links to the Journal of Electronic Justice that contained information about his conviction. The judge denied her request on the grounds that this kind of data is considered public. Google, the search engine used to find the information, was not considered liable for linking the document that is available on the Web. Therefore, all the imprisoned people and people accused of crimes has their personal data made available and it is considered public. 
</p>
<h3>Final considerations</h3>
<p>Although the relationship between Open Data policies and public data disclosure is not clearly interrelated, analyzing the policies where personal data was exposed as data considered for public interest helps to delineate where regulation needs to converge instead of collide or contradict themselves. Open Data policies can act as catalysts in processes that make data available to entities with different objectives, helping public policies to improve people's lives only if regulations do not prevent this processes. Open data must follow principles regarding citizens rights, adequate licences, better tools, individual agreement, in order to achieve its own purposes. The reality and practice has proven that the implementation is not always followed by the best choices and the diagnosis of the issues that surround this scenario is critical to foster truth in Open Data as a tool to help improve citizen life.  
</p>
<p>Measures related to the opening of data must meet a more comprehensive and multifaceted ecosystem. The pyramid view of the open data value framework, for example, used to explain open data in many contexts, base it's value proposition in creating value of the data, but does not mention protection or security as basis for the correct working of the framework. The pressures to meet international goals followed by a narrow view about the entire consequences and impacts of Open Data can undermine all efforts to have open data as a transparency tool and its use as a source to manage resources and foster citizen participation in public issues. As we could see in the case of HIV positive registration or pregnant women collection of data and monitoring, public administration is clearly ignoring the social and economic aspects evolved of information tracking and storage. Management designs are radically technical and don't take in account web technologies as interfaces between services and citizen, and far less count on the citizen as an important input of feedback to improve the Open Data utilization.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Given this introductory overview on government public policies and data collection practices, having agreements and common protocols to make easier for governments and other agencies to track and publicize results of policies for communities in vulnerable situations must go hand by hand with field research, mainly in developing. 
The personal data protection context of this communities demands a broader discussion on digital policies, including on the entire structure of the Open Data ecossystem chain directed towards an agenda of transparency that combines sustainable development with strong and coherent regulations mostly based on case studies and analysis.  At the technical level, every data posted on the Web by governmental agencies and public authorities should follow a unique manual regarding personal data. </p>
<p>For building a healthy and coherent chain around open data as a policy, software development, storage, collecting, cryptography, ownership of data, anonymization and delivery of data are critical elements that must be considered for building a framework to governments with strong digital agendas. Governmental public policies, laws and regulations should consider citizens rights in a perspective of human rights instead of merely consumers rights. </p>
<p>Ensuring that open data government initiatives are in step with society‚Äôs expectations in this area is a crucial mean of building trust. The challenge facing IT policy makers, coordinators and implementers is to respect accepted privacy principles while allowing the benefits of the Internet and other technologies flow to citizens. This balance is of particular importance when considering seamless government services involving data sharing among agencies. Of utmost importance is information privacy, individual‚Äôs claim to control the terms under which personal information is acquired, disclosed and used. Otherwise Open Data movement can be as harmless as perfunctory.
